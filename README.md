# python_view-source
Python file that can get the HTML of any site entered.

Basically, it just displays the HTML code of any site. Pretty simple, but it works.  
Working on a way to get the external files reference in the document (JS, CSS, etc.)  
Possibly could be used to download a site, but won't work fully without getting all external files.
